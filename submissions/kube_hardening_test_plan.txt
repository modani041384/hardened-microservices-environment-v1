Plan Testing

1. Pre-Deployment Testing:
- Unit Testing: Ensure all Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and scripts pass unit tests. 
Validate syntax, structure, and lint checks using tools like kubeval and helm lint.
- Static Analysis: Use static analysis tools like kube-score and kube-linter to identify potential 
security issues and best practices violations in Kubernetes manifests.
- Local Environment Testing: Deploy changes in a local Kubernetes environment using tools like 
Minikube or Kind. Validate basic functionality and stability.
2. Staging Environment Testing:
- Deployment in Staging: Apply the changes to a staging environment that mirrors the production cluster 
as closely as possible.
- Integration Testing: Execute integration tests to ensure that all components interact correctly. 
Use tools like Helm test and custom test suites.
- End-to-End Testing: Run end-to-end tests to validate the full application workflow. Utilize frameworks 
such as Ginkgo and Gomega for testing complex workflows.
3. Performance Testing:
- Load Testing: Use tools like k6 and JMeter to simulate high traffic and ensure the cluster can handle the load. 
Monitor resource utilization and response times.
- Stress Testing: Apply stress tests to identify the breaking point of the cluster and observe its behavior under extreme conditions.
